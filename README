== Welcome to BodyBlog

This is software where is driving my health-conscious blogging.  It currently allows one post per day, and provides a calendar view.  You can attach photos of your body to the blog post and any that are marked public will be visible on the website.

== TODO:

This is a list of things I still need to do

* Photo Type administration
* All photos show up (regardless of "public" status) if you are logged in
* Better "blogging" flow (adding images is a seperate step currently
* Feeds
* Removing Active Scaffolding requirement (not used, just stale requirement)
